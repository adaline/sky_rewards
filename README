Sorry did not have time to add model and SO specs,
I hope you can infer that I can complete these based on provided code.

To set up the project (assuming you have ruby and bundler gem):

  - git clone [repo url]
  - cd [repo path]
  - bundle
  - bundle exec rspec
  - bundle exec rackup

Thanks,
Valentin
